    <h1>Environmental Pollution</h1>
    <p>
        Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances or energy into the
        environment, leading to adverse effects on air, water, land, plants,
        animals, and human health. It is one of the most pressing global issues
        of the 21st century.

    <h2>What is Pollution?</h2>
    <p>
        Pollution refers to contamination of natural resources such as air,
        water, and soil. These contaminants may include chemicals, waste,
        particulate matter, or noise, which degrade the quality of the
        environment and disrupt the balance of ecosystems.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Pollution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Pollutants released into the air
            affect respiratory health and contribute to global warming.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Contaminated water bodies harm
            aquatic life and reduce safe drinking water availability.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil Pollution:</strong> Toxic substances in soil affect
            farming and enter the food chain.</li>
        <li><strong>Noise Pollution:</strong> Excess sound levels impact
            mental and physical wellbeing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Causes of Pollution</h3>
    <p>
        The major causes include industrial waste, vehicle emissions,
        household chemicals, agricultural runoff, plastic waste, and fossil
        fuel burning. These release harmful substances that deteriorate air,
        water, and land quality. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    </p>

    <h3>Effects on Human Health</h3>
    <p>
        Exposure to pollution can lead to respiratory disorders, cardiovascular
        diseases, weakened immune systems, and neurological problems. Long-term
        exposure may result in chronic illness or reduced life expectancy. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    </p>

    <h3>Solutions and Preventive Measures</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Promote clean energy (solar, wind power)</li>
        <li>Enforce pollution control regulations</li>
        <li>Reduce plastic usage and improve waste management</li>
        <li>Plant trees and improve green cover</li>
        <li>Encourage public transport and electric vehicles</li>
    </ul>
